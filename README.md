# FP Calculator Assistant

Welcome to the **FP Calculator Assistant**, a user-friendly tool designed for academic purposes to help you calculate **Function Points (FP)** — a widely used metric in software engineering for estimating the size and effort of software projects.

This project was developed as part of a **Software Metrics** academic course and provides a structured, step-by-step interface to guide users through all stages of the FP calculation process.

## 📋 Features

- ✅ Guided calculation of **Unadjusted Function Points (UFP)**
- ✅ Easy input form for **Degree of Influence (DI)**
- ✅ Automatic computation of **Technical Complexity Factor (TCF)**
- ✅ Final FP calculation with simple instructions
- ✅ Selection of **Programming Language** with corresponding **Average Value per Code line (AVC)**
- ✅ Automatic calculation of **Lines of Code (LOC)**
- ✅ Re-displayable instructions at any time using a dedicated button

## 🚀 How It Works

Follow these steps to complete your Function Point analysis using the tool:

1. **Calculate the Unadjusted Function Points (UFP)**  
   Enter the count of inputs, outputs, user queries, files, and external interfaces.

2. **Determine the Degree of Influence (DI)**  
   Fill out the DI form to assess the complexity of various aspects of the system.

3. **Compute the Technical Complexity Factor (TCF)**  
   Based on your DI inputs, the system computes the TCF automatically.

4. **Calculate the final Function Points (FP)**  
   The FP is calculated using the UFP and TCF values.

5. **Choose a Programming Language and its AVC**  
   Select a language from the list and its Average Value per Code line (AVC) will be used.

6. **Compute Lines Of Code (LOC)**  
   The system calculates the total estimated LOC using FP × AVC.

7. **You're Done!** 🎉
